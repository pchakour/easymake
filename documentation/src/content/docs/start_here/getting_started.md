Easymake is a **declarative build system** based on YAML files called **`Emakefile`**.  
It allows you to define **targets** composed of **steps**, which execute reusable **actions** (such as running a shell command, downloading a file, or creating an archive).  

Unlike traditional build tools, Easymake emphasizes **simplicity**, **extensibility**, and **structured documentation**.
