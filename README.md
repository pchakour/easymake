# Easymake

Easymake is a **declarative build system** based on YAML files called **`Emakefile`**.  
It allows you to define **targets** composed of **steps**, which execute reusable **actions** (such as running a shell command, downloading a file, or creating an archive).  

Unlike traditional build tools, Easymake emphasizes **simplicity**, **extensibility**, and **structured documentation**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Create your first project
Create a folder `my-project` and inside it create a file called `Emakefile`.

```yaml
targets:
  my_first_target:
    steps:
      - description: Say hello
        shell:
          cmd: echo "Hello !"
```

Run your target:

```sh
cd my-project
emake build //my_first_target
```

âœ… You should see `Hello !` printed.  
Emake will also create a `.emake` folder in your project (learn more about it [here](https://pchakour.github.io/easymake/emake_folder.html)).
